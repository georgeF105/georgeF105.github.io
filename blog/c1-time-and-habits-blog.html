      <h1>Time and Habits Blog</h1>

      <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>

        <p>I originally tried using a one hour time box and set about to read the resource material but found an hour too long. Time boxes of around 20 - 25 minutes, like the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> seems to work better for less engaging tasks.</p>

      <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>

        <p>I found the concept of Flow very interesting as it helped explain some of the more enjoyable and productive work I have done in the past. Particularly the note in the <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/how-to-achieve-the-creative-state-of-flow/">Pick the Brain</a> checklist around the fact that the task must be of the right level of difficulty, which explains why a difficult task after some practice can become more enjoyable and how a repetitive task can become tedious over time.</p>

      <h2>What worked for you?</h2>

        <p>I found breaking the task up into smaller time periods with mini breaks made completing the task and staying focused easier.</p>

      <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>

        <p>I like the idea of informal meditation, I currently work at a job that takes about half an hour to drive to. This is (usually) a good time to relax before and after work. This is a time that I would miss and would be keen to try and replicate if lost.</p>
