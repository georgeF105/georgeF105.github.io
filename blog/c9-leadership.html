            <h3>Leadership</h3>

            <h4>My experience of compassionate leadership.</h4>
            <p>I have experienced both good and bad leadership. After reading this chapter in hindsight I can see several traits in bad leaders that I have experienced that were at a minimum made worse by a lack of compassion and empathy. </p>

            <p>On the other hand I have had great leaders that have been able to inspire employees to perform better and have forged loyalty and trust due to their compassion.</p>

            <h4>Multiplying goodness meditation.</h4>
            <p>I found this to be a relaxing form of meditation and helpful for getting into a compassionate frame of mind.</p>

            <h4>Tonglen meditation.</h4>
            <p>I found this to be a pretty full on exercise. This combined with the multiplying goodness meditation seem to me to be very powerful tools for building compassion.</p>

            <h4>How the SCARF model apply to my Phase 0 experience.</h4>
            <p>I found the idea of the SCARF model very interesting, a while ago I had an insight into myself that relates to at least three of these principles. Several years ago I worked out that work became a lot more enjoyable when I knew or had some control over what I would be working on next. Even though this seems pretty obvious at the time it was a bit of a revelation for me.</p>

            <p>I can easily see how these principles can be applied on a personal level to a program like EDA in the following ways:</p>
            <p>Status comes from bettering ourselves</p>
            <p>Certainty comes in the form of clear expectations and goals for projects and assignments</p>
            <p>Autonomy in being able to mould our own learning.</p>
            <p>Relatedness in meeting new like minded people </p>
            <p>Fairness in terms of participating in and open honest and fair organisation. </p>
