      <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
        <p>
          Grid based design is a way of laying out a web page that splits the page into 12 vertical divisions this gives the ability to split a page evenly into 2, 3, 4, 6 or even 12 columns or 1/3rd, 2/3rd and so on. This is an elegant way of vertically splitting up a page and simplifies CSS styling allowing styles to be reused though out the page.
        </p>
      <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>

        <p>
          A responsive webpage is one that will adjust to suit for different devices based on the width of the screen. This means that someone viewing a page will see a different simplified layout than someone viewing the same page on a tablet or laptop.<br>This make for a much easier to navigate and all-round better website.
        </p>
      <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>

        <p>
          Semantic structure is the practice of using appropriate tags to define elements. An example would be using h1, h2, h3 tags etc. for headings / important text that needs to standout. These tags can be nested and makes styling the page a lot simpler.
        </p>
      <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>

        <p>
          I found the grid based design very interesting a can see the elegance of this layout technique. I keen about using this layout technique in my website.<br>I am also keen to find out more about display: flex; and flex-wrap: wrap; formats as this was only skimmed in the Udacity lesson. I will need to take more time to understand this fully.
