            <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
            <h4>Got blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
            <p>While building the racing game I needed to access the racing cars automatically using a looping function. I had the variable that the race cars were stored to but I needed a way access them using a index.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem went back to some of the course material. I knew it could be done as I remember seeing a very similar solution.</p>
            <p>Coming across this problem I initially felt pretty frustrated that I couldn’t remember something I saw done just a few days ago. But after finding the example that I remembered and solving the problem I felt pretty good about myself.</p>
            <p>I learnt more than I gained from the course material originally, a learnt not only how to apply the solution but also when a why the solution is needed.</p>
            <h4>Solved the problem in an elegant way:</h4>
            <p>In the racer game again I had a problem where I needed to store the same set of variable for multiple race cars and having different variables for each variable and for each car seemed like an inelegant way of solving the problem.</p>
            <p>Again I remembered seeing a similar example. I went back though the course material and found the example and modified it suit race cars rather than contacts.</p>
            <p>As I had already solved the problem but wanted to improve upon it I didn’t feel that frustrated, I was interested in how the problem could be solved in a simpler way.</p>
            <p>I learnt that spending a bit more time to find the simplest solution will often pay off in the long run. By spending a bit more time in the beginning I made the code a lot easier to work with and improve upon latter on.</p>

            <h3>Problem solving techniques:</h3>
            <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
            <p>When working on a difficult problem or if I get stuck I will use this technique either on paper or comments in the code itself.</p>
            <h4>Trying something</h4>
            <p>This is usually my starting point. Getting some code written and test a simplified version as soon as possible I find to be the most effective problem solving method for me.</p>
            <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
            <p>Talking to an inanimate object is something I would have trouble taking seriously but I do find it useful to explain my problem to someone, I often find that by the time I have finished my explanation I’ve either solved the problem in my head or have a good idea how to proceed.</p>
            <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
            <p>Reading error messages is a good way to identify typos or syntax errors.</p>
            <h4>Console.logging</h4>
            <p>I find logging to the console is a very helpful debugging tool, this give the ability to track key variables and also can give some information on the flow and operation of the code.</p>
            <h4>Googling</h4>
            <p>Googling is a key part of my problem solving process. I find that if I am having a problem and can word the search correctly I can usually find an example of someone with the same problem along with a solution.</p>
            <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
            <p>Asking for help would usually be a last resort, mostly because I find that having the answer given to me takes the fun out of solving the problem and means I wouldn’t learn as much as I would of if I’d solved the problem on my own.</p>
            <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
            <p>I haven’t yet had ask the coaches for help, I wouldn’t hesitate if I needed to but as for above I prefer to try and solve the problem myself first.</p>
            <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
            <p>Having the self-control to slow down and apply lessons learnt when in problem solving mode is usual my biggest hurdle to changing my habits. The process of writing down my reflections from the week has been a help to identify and reinforce improvements to my process.</p>
