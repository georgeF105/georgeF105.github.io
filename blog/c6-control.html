            <h3>Control</h3>
            <h4>What learnings did you take from this chapter?</h4>
            <p>I found the techniques talked about in this chapter quite interesting. Having worked in a role were conflict was sometimes unavoidable I have several examples of professional interpersonal conflict situations. Many of these situations in hindsight I wish I handled them better but with experience I have learnt some tools to deal with these stressful situations.</p>
            I practically liked the example of the man and his horse: when asked for his destination he had to refer to his horse. If we think of our emotions as being like this horse once we learn to control emotions rather than being controlled by our emotions we can take control of our destination / our reaction to stressful situations.
            <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
            <p>I found the process of reflecting on a negative situation and thinking about what caused the situation and how the situation could have been handled better using the techniques discussed an interesting process. I like the idea that thinking about previous experiences and focusing on how we could have done better can help us handle similar situations better in the future, this turns the process of dwelling on negative experiences in to a positive step.</p>
