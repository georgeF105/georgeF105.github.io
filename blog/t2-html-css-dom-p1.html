      <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is the contents of a webpage, if you thought of a book or magazine then the html would be the unformatted words and photos.<br>The DOM interprets the HTML and generates elements.<br>CSS is the styling rules, this takes the HTML elements and formats the words and pictures. If you think about a magazine the CSS would be the part the lays everything out and makes it look good.
        </p>
      <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>

        <p>
          Boxifying a design is the process of taking a design of a webpage and splitting it up into box elements. These boxes would then become elements in your page design.
        </p>
      <h2>What is the box model?</h2>

        <p>
          The box model is the rule that lays out every element on a web page. Every element (text box, image, shape) is made of a box/boxes.<br>The box model is the nested layout around every box. This consists of content at the centre, padding around this then border then the margin surrounding the whole lot.
