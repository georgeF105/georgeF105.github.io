    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experence?</h2>

      <p>The EDA course is an immersive leaning experience that empowers students to learn along with their cohort the tools and skills needed to be proficient developer. </p>

    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>

      <p>My initial impressions is that this course will require more than just learning new technical skills and tools, it will involves a lot more soft skill development than I had expected.</p>
      <p>I believe that this will be of a benefit not only to my affectedness as a developer but will also help in transitioning into this new profession.</p>

    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>

      <p>I am a big believer in the self-driven learning method and can see myself thriving in an environment that requires being self-driven.</p>
      <p> I would normally be a reluctant participant the some of the “soft skills” aspect of this course but I can see the value of these skills and will be making an effort to push myself in this area.</p>

    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>

      <p>My expectations haven’t changed that much mostly because I didn’t really know what to expect and my expectations were pretty vague. </p>

    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>

      <p>I am very excited to begin this course and participate in the EDA learning environment.</p>
      <p>It does make me a bit nervous, mostly around giving up my job and launching myself into the unknown but also around how I will fit into this environment.</p>
