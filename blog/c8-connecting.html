            <h4>Insight Techniques</h4>
            <p>I haven’t has a chance to use the insight techniques since reading this chapter, but I can see the value of techniques aimed at building trust. I found the description in this chapter about how a lack of trust in a work place can destructive affects and flow down effects very interesting. </p>
            <p>My previous work place had a serious lack of trust between departments caused by a blame culture formed by top management. It doesn’t take much to recall examples of “the five dysfunctions of a team” and how they had negative impacts on the performance of the company as a whole.</p>

            <h4>Empathic Listening</h4>
            <p>I found this to be quite an interesting exercise. I found that almost more information could be gained from a conversation (at least more information on the individual) by paying attention close attention to the feelings of the person.</p>

            <h4>Political Awareness</h4>
            <p>A situation that happened a while ago at work that I had almost forgotten about but came up recently. This happened over a phone conversation then was latter discussed in person about a week later, as I could see the situation from his perspective and had been in similar positions myself I apologised for a perceived lack of understanding on my part. I still feel like this wasn’t properly resolved.</p>
            <h5>The situation as I saw it.</h5>
            <p>I received a phone call from a reasonably irate dispatch manager complaining that he had asked my workmate for a manufacturing drawing for a subcontractor “over a week ago!!” and hadn’t received anything and now the subcontractor was complaining that we were holding up his plant and basically the world was going to end. </p>
            <p>As I explained to him: Firstly we (me and my workmate) produce the drawings it’s not our responsibility to supply contractors or dispatch managers with manufacturing information. Secondly it’s not the job of a dispatch manager to talk to subcontractors or supply them with potentially wrong information, we have systems in place for this and a whole department for managing purchasing (called the purchasing department they can get it wrong all on their own). Thirdly in future instead of bypassing the system and asking a forgetful designer for something that is not his job pass the request from the subcontractor on to the right people.</p>
            <h5>From his perspective.</h5>
            <p>He had a call from a subcontractor who was under pressure to get a job done and as a company we had failed to supply the information need to do the job. In order to help the contractor out as quickly as possible he had gone straight to the source and asked the person who designed the component to supply the manufacturing information to make the part.</p>
            <p>After a week of not receiving the requested information the undoubtedly annoyed subcontractor called him up again asking for said information. When asking again for the promised information he not only didn’t receive an apology but a little shit (who is probably 20 years his junior and has no idea what’s involved in his job) told him that he wasn’t doing his job properly and he was going to bypass him and pass the issue on to another department who caused the issue to start with.</p>
