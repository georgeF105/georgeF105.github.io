            <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
            <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
            <p>Following the ‘process over product’ theory meant trying to follow the process talked about in previous lessons. I came up against several dead end’s that meant back tracking and going back to previous steps. For example the initial wireframe layout designs proved to be either too ambitious or lacked usability, this meant redesigning the wireframes. I imagine a certain amount of design iteration is part of the normal design process but I feel like most of the issues I came against were due to inexperience.</p>
            <h3>What did you think of meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
            <p>Before reading the second chapter I thought meditation was about relaxing and clearing you mind of distractions. I thought that the benefits of meditation could more easily be achieved in more enjoyable or productive ways.</p>
            <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
            <p>After reading the second chapter I learn that meditation is not only about clearing your mind of distractions but also about focusing and improving the ability to clear you mind of distractions. It also involves creating a greater awareness of your body and in doing so gaining a better insight into your emotions and how to control them.</p>
            <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques standout to you?</h3>
            <p>The technique of focusing on your breathing stood out to me as the most promising. I find the idea of simply eliminating all distracting thoughts without something else to focus on very difficult.</p>
