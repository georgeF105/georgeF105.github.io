      <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
        <p>
          I found the concept of emotional intelligence quite interesting. I hadn’t come across this formally before EDA but have experienced both good and bad emotional intelligence in the work place and in personal life. I find it easy to believe the relative importance of emotional intelligence as compared to intelligence quotient when it comes to success in the work place. <br>I found it interesting that there are parts of our brain specifically designed to detect danger and to keep us safe that are not hard wired to our conscious thoughts but communicate with us though our body. This explains “gut feelings” and the intuition that we sometimes experience, but can’t explain, that everything is not right.
        </p>
      <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
        <p>
          I found two minutes of mindfulness quite relaxing. I was expecting it to a lot harder that it was, I was quite surprised how quickly two minutes went. I would consider trying to make this a habit.
